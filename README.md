# Movie-Recommendation
Just completed my AI/ML project on Movie Recommendation System! 🎬📊 Enter a movie name like Inception, and get a list of similar movies suggested based on their content and features. 🔥 Used TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity, and enumerate() to build this system. Excited to explore more in the world of AI-powered recommendations! 🚀
